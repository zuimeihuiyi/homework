               　　　　　　AI opens the next act of the Internet
　　Internet technology has been developed rapidly , China has   reached more than 700 million Internet users nowadays. Overall, the Internet technology has gone through two stages, starting from PC Internet in 1994 to 2012, the Internet changed people's lives and the whole world; from 2012 to now, almost everyone knew that the wave of the Internet has changed the life. Severial years later, artificial intelligence will open the next screen of the Internet.

　　China's economy has entered a new stage, the national policy has been advocated "The Internet +" action plan in order to combine the Internet and each industry to enhance operational efficiency. As the economic promote rapidly with sustained speed, our country promote economic growth with Internet technology, but the growth of the mobile Internet has already reached a bottleneck. Many people with the Internet access are using Internet technology including smart phones and computer users. Mobile Internet growth process only took four years based on the 18 years-PC Internet to reach the universal state, the entire Internet industry has begun to face a huge challenge, the Internet market to high-speed, steady growth is the protection of artificial intelligence.

　　"The future of traditional enterprises are dealing with large amounts of data in the cloud with artificial intelligence." said Ma Huateng, chairman of Tencent's board of directors, at the" Internet + "Digital Economy Summit. Generally speaking, cloud computing is the virtualization of hardware resources which is equivalent to our computer. And the operating system, a large number of hardware resources after the distribution of the use of virtualization. Large data is the efficient processing of massive data. In general, cloud computing as the bottom of the computing resources to support the upper layer of large data processing, and large data with real-time interactive query efficiency and analysis capabilities or imagine, "move the mouse can operate in the second class PB level Data "is an crazy imagining picture. Artificial intelligence technology is a very wide range of technologies, it covers voice recognition, image recognition, natural language understanding. And at the same time the large data, cloud computing are closely linked with it.

　　At present, cloud computing has not only cloud storage and computing power demand, it is more and more large data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence "Trinity" thing. Many industries give customers the value is not a simple storage capacity and simple computing power, but the ability to deal with large-scale data, such as the very accurate user portraits, the very good positioning ability and the ability to analyze the map. Actually all of these abilities combined to play a very unique role in various industries. And these abilities is precisely the artificial intelligence of large data on the fine application. Artificial intelligence is in the cloud computing and large data on the basis of more high-end technology, while the three are closely related, when they are all together for the enterprise to provide technical services, human development will be limitless.

　　"Artificial intelligence" has been from a sophisticated technology that everyone can talk about the hot topic. Including speech recognition, speech synthesis and image recognition technology. Robot "degree secret" settled in Shanghai Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant for customers ordering , "automated car" and so on are the embodiment of the artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has a huge impact on the manufacturing industry in every area, it is more and more close to the human ability, not only can liberate people from the simple brain work but also revitalize the traditional industries and the reconstruction of traditional industries. So artificial intelligence as well as depth learning in the Internet field will be more and more popular. It shows a more exciting time follows the mobile Internet , and AI is able to give us a variety of imagination, a variety of possibilities of the new era.

                     　　　　　　　人工智能开启互联网的下一幕 


　　互联网技术在全世界行业中一直快速发展，中国现在已经达到超过7亿的网民。总体来说，互联网技术经历了两个阶段，从1994年PC互联网开始兴起到2012年为止，互联网改变了人们的生活也改变了世界；从2012年到现在，几乎每个人都真切地感受到了移动互联网的浪潮对生活的改变；而人工智能将开启互联网的下一幕。

　　我国经济已经进入新常态阶段，国家政策非常提倡“互联网+”行动计划，让互联网和每一个行业结合来提升运营效率，从而推动经济持续、高速地增长。国家靠互联网推动经济的增长，但移动互联网本身的增长已经达到瓶颈了。很多具备上网条件的人群都在使用互联网技术，包括智能手机和电脑的使用者。移动互联网在PC互联网18年的成长历程下仅走了4年时间就已经达到普及的状态，整个互联网行业已经开始面临着巨大的挑战，互联网市场要高速、稳步增长的保障就是人工智能。

　　腾讯董事会主席马化腾在“互联网+”数字经济峰会上表示：“传统企业的未来，是在云端用人工智能处理大数据。” 通俗来讲，云计算就是硬件资源的虚拟化，相当于我们的计算机和操作系统，将大量的硬件资源虚拟化之后再进行分配使用，而大数据就是海量数据的高效处理。一般来说，云计算作为计算资源的底层，支撑着上层的大数据处理，而大数据具备实时交互式的查询效率和分析能力，想象一下，“动一下鼠标就可以在秒级操作PB级别的数据”是一幅什么样的图景。人工智能技术是一个范围非常广泛的技术，它涵盖了语音识别、图像识别、自然语言理解同时越来越和大数据、云计算紧密相连。

　　目前，云计算已经不仅是云存储和对计算能力的需求，它越来越是大数据、云计算和人工智能“三位一体”的东西。很多行业给客户提供的价值不是简单的存储能力和简单的计算能力，而是大规模处理数据的能力，比如说非常精准的用户画像的能力，非常好的定位能力和对地图的分析能力等，所有这些能力结合起来，其实在各个行业能够发挥出它非常独特作用。而这些能力恰恰是人工智能对大数据的精美应用。人工智能是在云计算和大数据的基础上更高端的技术，同时三者又息息相关，当它们全部糅合在一起为企业去提供技术服务的时候，人类的发展将是不可限量的。

　　“人工智能”已经从一个高精尖的科技变成了人人都可以街谈巷议的热门话题了。包括语音识别、语音合成和图像识别技术；机器人“度秘”入驻上海肯德基餐厅为顾客点餐及“无人车”等都是人工智能的展现，人工智能对制造业的几乎每一个领域都可以产生巨大的影响，它越来越接近人类的能力，不仅能把人从简单的脑力劳动中解放出来，还能盘活传统产业，重构传统产业。所以人工智能，深度学习在互联网领域将大行其道。它继移动互联网之后一个更加激动人心、更加能够给我们带来各种各样想象、各种各样可能性的新时代。
